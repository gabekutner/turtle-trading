Units as a measure of Risk

The Turtles were given risk management rules that limited the number of Units that
we could maintain at any given time, on four different levels. In essence, these rules
controlled the risk that a trader could carry, and these limits minimized losses
during prolonged losing periods, as well as during extraordinary price movements.

The limits were: 
Level    Type                                Maximum Units
1        Single Market                       4 units
2        Closely Correlated Markets          6 units
3        Loosely Correlated Markets          10 units
4        Single Direction -- Long or Short   12 units
